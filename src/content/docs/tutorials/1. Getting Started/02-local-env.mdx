In this step you are going to install Docker, VS Code, and setup a DevContainer for your project.

## Install Docker

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Docker Desktop for Windows & Mac" icon="laptop">
    MacOS and Windows should install Docker Desktop. 
    Follow the instructions for [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Docker for Linux" icon="linux">
    Choose your distribution and follow the steps on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify your docker installation by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

## Install Visual Studio Code

Install Visual Studio Code via your preferred option, such as the [Webpage](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or a package manager.
Verify your installation by opening Visual Studio Code.

## Create a simple DevContainer

- Open the command palette in Visual Studio Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on MacOS.
- Type `Dev Container: Add Dev Container Configuration Files...` and select it.
    - Hint the search is fuzzy, so you can type `dev add` and it should show up.
- When selecting the template, choose `Ubuntu`, with the default settings.
- Select the features you need, for example `Python`, and press `OK`
    - You can select `Keep Defaults` in don't need a certain version or extra features & tools.
- Done!

You should now see a `.devcontainer` folder in your project with a `devcontainer.json` file.

```json title=".devcontainer/devcontainer.json" {4-9}
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/ubuntu
{
	"name": "Ubuntu",
	// Or use a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. More info: https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:jammy",
	"features": {
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {}
	}

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

	// Use 'postCreateCommand' to run commands after the container is created.
	// "postCreateCommand": "uname -a",

	// Configure tool-specific properties.
	// "customizations": {},

	// Uncomment to connect as root instead. More info: https://aka.ms/dev-containers-non-root.
	// "remoteUser": "root"
}
```

A popup should appear asking you to reopen the project in the DevContainer. Click `Reopen in Container`.
If not, open the command palette and type `Dev Container: Reopen in Container`.

:::note
Depending on the features you selected, the DevContainer might take a few minutes to build.
You can monitor the progress by clicking `show log` in the bottom right.
:::

Verify that you are in the DevContainer by opening a terminal in Visual Studio Code and running:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the Python version installed in the DevContainer:

```bash
vscode âžœ /workspaces/python-gh-actions $ python --version
Python 3.10.12
```
