description: Common patterns for using Dev Containers in VS Code
---

This guide provides common patterns for using Dev Containers in VS Code. Dev Containers are a way to define a development environment in a container that is isolated from your local machine. This allows you to have a consistent development environment across different machines and operating systems. Dev Containers are defined using a `devcontainer.json` file that specifies the Docker image to use, the extensions to install, and other settings. This guide will cover how to create a Dev Container, how to use it in VS Code, and common patterns for using Dev Containers in your development workflow.

## Common Patterns

### Creating a Dev Container

There are two ways to create a Dev Container in VS Code:

#### Manually creating a `devcontainer.json` file

You can create a `devcontainer.json` file manually by adding it to your project folder.
See the [Reference](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/) for the file format and available fields.

Using this way you need to manually define the template and features.

- [Available Templates](https://containers.dev/templates)
- [Available Features](https://containers.dev/features)

#### Using VS Code

- Open the command palette in Visual Studio Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on MacOS.
- Type `Dev Container: Add Dev Container Configuration Files...` and select it.
    - Hint the search is fuzzy, so you can type `dev add` and it should show up.
- When selecting the template, choose `Ubuntu` for example, with the default settings.
- Select the features you need, for example `Python`, and press `OK`
    - You can select `Keep Defaults` in don't need a certain version or extra features & tools.
- Done!

You should now see a `.devcontainer` folder in your project with a `devcontainer.json` file.

```json title=".devcontainer/devcontainer.json" {4-9}
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/ubuntu
{
	"name": "Ubuntu",
	// Or use a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. More info: https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:jammy",
	"features": {
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {}
	}

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

	// Use 'postCreateCommand' to run commands after the container is created.
	// "postCreateCommand": "uname -a",

	// Configure tool-specific properties.
	// "customizations": {},

	// Uncomment to connect as root instead. More info: https://aka.ms/dev-containers-non-root.
	// "remoteUser": "root"
}
```

### Opening the current project in a DevContainer

When opening a project which has a `devcontainer.json` file, you will be prompted to open the project in a DevContainer. If not, you can open the command palette and type `Dev Container: Reopen in Container`.

:::note
Depending on the features you selected, the DevContainer might take a few minutes to build.
You can monitor the progress by clicking `show log` in the bottom right.

### Adding features to the DevContainer

There are again two ways to add features to the DevContainer, via the `devcontainer.json` file or using the command palette.

Add [features](https://containers.dev/features) to the `devcontainer.json` file to install additional tools and extensions in the DevContainer.

```diff json title=".devcontainer/devcontainer.json" 
{
    "name": "Ubuntu",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:jammy",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {},
+        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {}
    }
}
```

Or via the command palette: `Dev Container: Configure Container Features...` and select the features you need.

You should be prompted to rebuild the DevContainer after adding features, if not [rebuild the DevContainer](#rebuilding-the-devcontainer).


### Rebuilding the DevContainer

If you need to rebuild the DevContainer, you can open the command palette and type `Dev Container: Rebuild Container` or a similar option.
